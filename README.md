fast-tracks
===========

Sound Cloud alternate UI with focus on fast access to Favourite (as opposed to SoundCloud web which is partial and unusable to browse as a whole)

The project is gonna branch into a module meant for anything you want through the simple directives:

stream
mytracks
myfavourites

Only streaming content directives for now but really. Get invovled in any way
