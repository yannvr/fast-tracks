fast-tracks
===========

Sound Cloud alternate UI with focus on fast access to streaming content (as opposed to SoundCloud web which is partial and unusable to browse as a whole)

The project is gonna branch into a module meant for anything you want through the simple directives:

stream
mytracks
myfavourites

Only streaming content directives for now because really, it's about finding a track fast without scrolling
